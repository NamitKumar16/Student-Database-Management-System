# work
I am making this project as a task for my internship.
This is basic project which fetches details from a database and displays them. Laravel is a PHP based web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
It also contains login-signup functionality which matches the details from the database and after verification allows the user to view the deatils. 
I am planning to make this project responsive using AJAX.
Also working on inline edit.
THANK YOU!
