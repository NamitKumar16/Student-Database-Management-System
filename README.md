I am making this project as a task for my internship.
This is basic project which fetches details from a database and displays them. Laravel is a PHP based web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
It also contains login-signup functionality which matches the details from the database and after verification allows the user to view the deatils. 
AJAX is used for all communication with the server and it does not reload. You can also add a student or edit or delete it using the buttons.
THANK YOU!
